## thoughts about task 2, 
Today, I dedicated several hours to learning about new technologies in the blockchain space. This process involved delving into areas I was previously unfamiliar with, and while it was educational, I acknowledge there's much more to learn before I can confidently navigate these tools.

A significant part of the day was spent trying to understand Hardhat. Grasping its purpose and functionalities proved to be challenging. Additionally, attempting to modify and deploy scripts that were automatically generated by Hardhat turned out to be quite complex, especially considering the limited timeframe of a single day.

Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my understanding and skills in this area. The work done today lays a foundation, but future commits are necessary to enhance and improve the overall project. This is just the beginning of a longer journey towards proficiency in these technologies.
